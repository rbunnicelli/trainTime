Overview:

The goal of this web app is to show users a real-time Train Schedule. Users can view the current train schedule with accurate information on how many minutes until the next train and what time the next train is coming. In addition, users have the ability to add other trains by inputting the Train Name, Train Destination, First Train Time, and Frequency of the Train. We are using Materialize as our CSS framework and Firebase as our back-end.

Issues:

The base functionality is all there. There were some issues integrating the "Bonus" challenges. In the first iteration, there was a "Delete" column with trash can gliphcons. I was able to code an on-click function to remove the row but, it was only on the local machine. I could not figure out how to delete the node from firebase. I also had issues with the real-time changing of the "Minutes Away" and "Next Train Time" fields. If you open the browser you will see the correct info for that specific time but it will not update unless you refresh the page.
